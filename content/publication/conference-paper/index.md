abstract: In vacuum, thermal energy is transported by photons (thermal radiation) but not phonons. Recent studies, however, indicated that phonon heat transfer across a vacuum gap is mediated by the quantum fluctuation of electromagnetic fields. Specifically, in the heat exchange between two objects separated by a nanoscale vacuum gap, phonons carry thermal energy more efficiently than photons. However, it remains unclear if phonons can propagate without electromagnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate that phonon transmission across a sub-nanometer vacuum gap can be induced by quasi-Casimir force subjected to the Lennard–Jones atoms using classical molecular dynamics simulation. The net heat flux across the vacuum gap increases exponentially as the gap distance decreases, owing to acoustic phonon transmission. The local heat flux, evaluated using the Irving–Kirkwood method, increases singularly at the interfacial layers, while that at the inner layers agrees well with the net heat flux. These findings provide evidence of the strong thermal resonance induced by quasi-Casimir coupling between the interfacial layers. Thus, we conclude that the quasi-Casimir coupling induced by intermolecular interaction is a heat transfer mode for phonon heat transfer across a vacuum gap in nanoscale.

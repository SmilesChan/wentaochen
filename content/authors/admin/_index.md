I am a postdoctoral researcher at Heat Transfer Lab in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Kyushu Institute of Technology, Japan. I have a particular focus on near-field heat transfer, thermal transport at the solid-solid and solid-liquid interface, and molecular dynamics simulation.

Currently, I am working on a project named thermal resonance induced by quasi-Casimir coupling for innovative nanoscale thermal management, supported by through the Grant-in-Aid for Research Activity Start-up, Project No. 22K20412.
